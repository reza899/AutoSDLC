### Security Principles

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all components
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
4. **Secure by Default**: Security enabled out of the box
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection

## Agent Security

### Agent Isolation

**Network Isolation Requirements:**
- Kubernetes NetworkPolicy configuration restricts agent communication
- Only authorized namespaces can access agent MCP server ports (8081)
- Agents limited to specific egress destinations (MCP server, GitHub API)
- Process isolation with non-root user execution

**Process Security Configuration:**
- Run as non-root user (UID 1000) with minimal capabilities
- Read-only root filesystem prevents tampering
- SecComp profiles restrict system calls
- Drop all capabilities except NET_BIND_SERVICE

### Agent Authentication

**Certificate-Based Authentication:**
- X.509 certificates for agent identity verification
- Certificate chain validation against trusted CAs
- Automatic certificate revocation checking
- Session tokens with 1-hour expiry

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Agent presents certificate and signature
2. System verifies certificate validity and chain
3. Signature validation confirms agent identity  
4. JWT session token issued with role-based permissions

### Secure Agent Communication

**Encryption Standards:**
- AES-256-GCM for message encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- Unique IV per message prevents pattern analysis
- Authentication tags prevent tampering

**Message Security:**
- All MCP messages encrypted end-to-end
- Timestamp validation prevents replay attacks
- Message integrity verified via auth tags
- 5-minute message validity window

### Code Execution Sandboxing

**Resource Limits:**
- Maximum memory: 512MB per execution
- CPU timeout: 30 seconds
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Restricted module access (path, fs, crypto, util, @autosdlc/sdk only)

**Security Measures:**
- VM2 isolation for code execution
- Worker threads for additional isolation
- Static analysis for dangerous patterns (eval, Function, child_process)
- Input/output validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive audit logging for all executions

## Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Role Definitions:**
- **autosdlc-admin**: Full cluster access for platform management
- **autosdlc-developer**: Limited access to deployments, jobs, pods (read/write)
- **autosdlc-operator**: Infrastructure management with deployment updates
- **autosdlc-viewer**: Read-only access to all resources for monitoring

### API Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Methods:**
- API Key authentication with SHA-256 hashing
- OAuth2 Bearer token validation
- JWT cookie-based authentication
- Rate limiting per API key

**Authorization Process:**
- User permission lookup after authentication
- Resource-action access validation
- Authorization failure logging and alerting
- Insufficient permission blocking with audit trail

### Multi-Factor Authentication

**MFA Implementation:**
- TOTP-based authentication using speakeasy
- QR code generation for authenticator app setup
- 32-character secret generation with encryption
- Backup codes (10 single-use codes) for recovery
- 2-step time window tolerance for clock drift

## Data Security

### Encryption at Rest

**Data Encryption Strategy:**
- AES-256-GCM algorithm for all sensitive data
- AWS KMS integration for key management
- Classification-based key selection (public/internal/confidential/secret)
- Automatic IV generation and auth tag validation

**Key Management:**
- Separate encryption keys per data classification level
- Automatic data key generation through KMS
- Encrypted key storage with plaintext key isolation
- Key rotation and lifecycle management

### Secrets Management

**Secret Storage:**
- Kubernetes SealedSecrets for encrypted secret storage
- External Secrets Operator for AWS Secrets Manager integration
- Automated secret rotation with overlap periods
- Encrypted backup code generation and storage

### Key Rotation

**Rotation Schedule:**
- API keys: 90 days
- JWT secrets: 30 days
- Encryption keys: 365 days
- Certificates: 365 days

**Rotation Process:**
- Overlapping validity periods during transitions
- Automated user notification for key updates
- Failed rotation logging and alerting
- Verification of successful key application

## Network Security

### TLS Configuration

**TLS Standards:**
- TLS 1.3 only with strong cipher suites
- ECDHE key exchange for forward secrecy
- OCSP stapling for certificate validation
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with preload

**Security Headers:**
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Content Security Policy for script/style restrictions
- Public Key Pinning for certificate validation

### Network Policies

**Default Security:**
- Deny-all ingress policy as baseline
- Explicit allow rules for required communication
- Agent egress limited to DNS, MCP server, and GitHub API
- Namespace-based traffic segmentation

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning

**Automated Security Scanning:**
- Snyk vulnerability scanning with high-severity threshold
- npm audit with automatic fix application
- OWASP Dependency Check for comprehensive analysis
- Trivy container scanning for image vulnerabilities
- CodeQL static analysis and Semgrep security rules

### Security Patching

**Patch Management Process:**
- Vulnerability severity classification (critical/high/medium/low)
- Staging environment testing before production application
- Automated patch prioritization and application
- Verification of successful patch deployment
- Security event logging for all patch activities

## Incident Response

### Incident Response Plan

**Response Timeline:**
- Critical: 15 minutes response, immediate escalation
- High: 60 minutes response, 1-hour escalation
- Medium: 4 hours response, 4-hour escalation
- Low: 24 hours response, 24-hour escalation

**Response Process:**
1. Detection & Analysis of security incident
2. Containment through component isolation and IP blocking
3. Eradication of identified threats and vulnerabilities
4. Recovery of affected systems and services
5. Post-incident analysis and recommendations
6. Stakeholder notification and documentation

### Security Monitoring

**Detection Rules:**
- Brute force attack detection (5 failed logins in 60 seconds)
- Privilege escalation attempts on admin resources
- Data exfiltration through large external transfers
- Code injection patterns in agent execution

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
